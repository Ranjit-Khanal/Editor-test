## Key Components

### MonacoEditor (`monacoeditor.tsx`)
The core Monaco editor implementation that provides the code editing functionality. This component handles the basic Monaco editor setup and configuration.

### Wrapper (`wrapper.tsx`)
A higher-level wrapper component around the Monaco editor that provides additional functionality and integration with the application.

### App (`App.tsx`)
The main application component that orchestrates the editor components and overall application layout.

### Server (`server/`)
Contains server-side code for handling editor-related operations and services.

## Getting Started

1. The application entry point is `main.tsx`
2. The Monaco editor integration is handled through `monacoeditor.tsx` and `wrapper.tsx`
3. Styles are managed through CSS files corresponding to components
